                    The great, mighty, powerful ---more wording here--- <b>PHARAOH</b>, runs this country and cares deeply for everyone and everything. His hard work on all of our
                    behalves did not go unnoticed, and the Almighty G-d of Israel sent him a confirmation. And so, in the year XXX, month XXX Pharaoh <b>HAD A DREAM</b>.
                </p>
                <p style={{ fontSize: 18 }}>
                    In his dream,
                    Pharaoh was standing on the Nile River, when seven fat cows emerged from it. Following them, were seven skinny cows. The seven skinny cows swallowed the seven
                    fat ones, yet they remained as emaciated as before. This dream is disturbing enough, but then Pharaoh had a second one. The second dream was quite similar –
                    but instead of cows, they were XXXX of wheat. When Pharaoh awoke, he called all ministers to an urgent meeting, but none of them could interpret the dream to
                    satisfaction. Finally, the cupbearer remembered. A few years prior, he and a friend had been imprisoned together. They both had dreams of their pending verdict,
                    yet were unsure how to understand them. Yet a young Hebrew slave in prison with them explained every detail to perfection. And this man’s name was Imhotep.

                    <b>IMHOTEP</b>, a slave first named Yosef from the land of Canaan, was originally the Pharaoh’s chief executioner Potiphar’s house manager. An erroneous scandal put him
                    in prison, where he met Pharaoh's condemned servents. Their dreams brought Imhotep's knowledge to light. He was brought before Pharaoh and clarified that his knowledge isn’t inborn – the Almighty G-d Who sends
                    the dreams sends the interpretation to him as well. Upon hearing the dream, his worth was proven, and he explained:

                        The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears of grain are seven years; it is one dream. And the seven meager and ugly cows coming up after them are
                        seven years, and the seven empty ears of grain, beaten by the east wind, will be seven years of famine. It is this matter that I have spoken to Pharaoh; what God is
                        about to do He has shown Pharaoh. Behold, seven years are coming, great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt. And seven years of famine will arise after them, and
                        all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine will destroy the land. And the plenty will not be known because of that famine to follow, for it
                        will be very severe. And concerning the repetition of the dream to Pharaoh twice that is because the matter is ready to emanate from God, and God is hastening to execute it.

                    Yet he was not done, for Imhotep <b>HAD A DREAM</b>. He dreamt of surviving the famine, sustaining the economy, holding the country up, and making Egypt a world power.
                    And so he formulated a plan, and told it to Pharaoh. Pharaoh liked the sound of it, and appointed Imhotep head of what is now known as the Seven Year Grain Plan.
